- need to wrap the flocking into a class.
- write test cases for that class these could include
    - a timing example for a specific set of cases iterating over image size and particle number. This could actually return logged timing to see if there is any variation over time
    - visual check examples. ie two particles from opposite sides colliding, a couple of parallel particles from one side. stationary particle in center(null check)
- after all this, make a new class that uses kd-trees instead. benchmark against brute force.

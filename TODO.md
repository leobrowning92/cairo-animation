- The end goal of this would be to allow the passing of custom colormaps. see [this](http://bsou.io/posts/color-gradients-with-python) article for an extremely clear article on how to generate the colormaps for the future.
- then would be interesting to play around with non uniform color gradients, iehter from multiple linear interpolations, or via bezier curves.

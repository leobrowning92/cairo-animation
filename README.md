# cairo-animation

some work on animating and/or producting images based on pseudo-random motion
Heavily inspired and motivated by the work of [Anders Hoff](inconvergent.net)

### ideas to impliment
- could have the size of the particle vary with spead. The idea came from inkplumes under water. To achieve this, as speed slowed, size could increase making the darker areas of the work bigger
